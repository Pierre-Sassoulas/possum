History
=======

Firstly, there was a need my brother to open his
brewery. A brief state of the art showed me some interesting solutions
but often heavy and / or complicated to implement.

I was looking for something simple that I had the mastery. I
am engaged in a short development (approximately 15 days) for a first
Python/Qt3/Sqlite3 version. Today, the number of hours has grown :)
This first version has been running for almost one year without change
with a touch screen, a PC mini-ITX VIA processor and printer
to ticket.

The current name of the software came a year later with the invaluable assistance
Yvon Benoist at the time English teacher in higher education.

The first invoice output POSSUM dated 01/05/2008 at 19:28 at the brewery
**le Saint SaÃ«ns** in Rouen, Normandy, France.
